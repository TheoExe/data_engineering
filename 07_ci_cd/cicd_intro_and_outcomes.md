### Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Motivation
The practice of continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) aims to keep running code available to end-users continuously.
It depends on two main practices:

1) small code check-ins with high frequency
2) automated unit integration and deployment tests running on each code check-in

### Learning Outcomes
- Connect a GitHub repo to CircleCI and have it run automated tests on each push
- Understand the benefits of CI/CD
- Understand the many uses of the Jenkins as a build, testing and deployment tool

### TO-DOs
- Take Quiz
- Reading
- Complete and Submit Lab
