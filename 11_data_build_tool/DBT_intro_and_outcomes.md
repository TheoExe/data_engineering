### Data Build Tool Motivation

DBT is a development framework allowing you to modularize SQL and use Data Engineering best practices.  
It does this by allowing you templetize SQL so you can reuse it and build larger SQL statements for Transforming data modules.  
If you're familiar with Python's template language, Jinja, you'll find it easy to pick up.  
Since these templates are just files, you can use github to version control your Transformations.  
DBT also allows you to automate some of the basic data testing which is another big feature for best practices in Data Engineering.
