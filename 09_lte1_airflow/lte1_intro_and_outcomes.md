### LTE 1 Motivation
We now turn to Data Engineering tools, starting with Airflow.  Airflow is a workflow management tool where workflow means a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of tasks.  Airflow provides for the configuration, dependency and execution control of the various workflows.  It is based on Python, which is convenient since Python is also ubiquitous in Data Science

### Learning Outcomes

- Download and start up the default Airflow docker image and run it on your local machine.
- Create a basic set of tasks for Airflow.
- Be familiar with starting and stopping a workflow in Airflow.
