### Snowflake Motivation
This week we look at our first cloud-native Data Engineering tool: Snowflake.  
Unlike other tools we've looked at so far, this tool is pure SAAS (Software As A Service).  
There is no software to install: you sign up on the web and everything is backed by cloud servers.  
It is a paid service, but it is extremely useful and one of the leading tools in Data Engineering.  
It is essentially a Data Warehouse and Database in the cloud.  

Snowflake provides a free 30-day trial, so we'll use that to learn the basics.  
In our next lecture, we'll link Snowflake to DBT, (Data Build Tool) which will allow you greater control to manage the data ETL in Snowflake.  
By comparison, DBT is an open source tool offering both cli and web interfaces.  
The combination of Snowflake-DBT is widely used in Data Engineering, and because of its overlap, is useful to Data Analysts and Data Scientists alike.

### Learning Outcomes
